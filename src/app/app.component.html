<!-- Example of ctor argument passed through html attributes. Note that this is an expression, so the name is wrapped in quotes. This can also be written as plain html in this case, without executing an expression (nom="Germain"). Careful with browser-reserved attributes ("hidden", "onClick", etc.). -->
<!-- <tc-collegues [nom]="'Germain'" prenom="Christophe" (outputEmitter)="handleOutput($event)"></tc-collegues> -->
